HtZip is a lightweight HTTP Server that serves files out of Zip Archives on the server by only uncompressing the requested file.

INSTALL

HTZip can be started directly and does not need any installation. If you downloaded the Jar File you will need a Java Virtual Machine. The htzip file is a Linux x86/32bit executable that runs without Java.

USAGE

Start HTZip with java -jar HTZip.jar Config.xml for the Jar file or ./HTZip Config.xml for the Linux binary. HTZip will start up and listen to the IP Address and Port specified in the configuration for incoming HTTP Requests. On incoming requests it will serve files from the folder specified in the XML file.

EXAMPLE

HtZip is able to serve the JDK Documentation without the need to extract them. If you start HTZip with this XML File

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<HTZipConfig>
        <IP>127.0.0.1</IP>
        <Folder>.</Folder>
        <Port>1234</Port>
</HTZipConfig>

and you have the jdk-6-doc.zip file (Suns JDK Javadocs) in the directory sun, then this URL http://127.0.0.1:1234/sun/jdk-6-doc.zip/docs/index.html will bring you directly to the start Page of the JDK6 Javadoc Documentation without extracting the whole archive.
